# Camera Alarm
<p>This scetch controls alarm settings of XMEYE cameras</p>
<p>XMEYE IP cameras have one really useful function. It is a voice smart alarm. If you activate it, the camera will make a loud sound
from its speaker when the camera detects the shape of a human. Additionally bright light turns on in the dark time. So a security alarm
guards your house inside and the cameras guard your house outside. But there is a problem. You have to activate or deactivate smart alarm
function on each camera. If you have a lot of cameras it can be inconvenient to do every time.</p>
<p>It is better to activate the alarm function on the cameras automatically when you activate the house security alarm. When you deactivate the house
security alarm  cameraâ€™s alarm will deactivate automatically as well.</p>
<p>My device connects to house security alarm. If you activate your house security alarm my device acivates the alarm function on each camera.<>
When you deactivate your security system my device deactivate the alarm function on the cameras. My device is based on the ESP8266. It must be connected
to home network to control smart alarm on the cameras through WiFi.</p>
