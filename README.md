# Camera_Alarm
<p>This scetch controls alarm settings of XMEYE cameras</p>
<p>XMEYE IP cameras have one really useful function. It is voice smart alarm. If you activate it, the camera will make loud voice messages
from its speaker when the camera detects the shape of a human. The bright light will turn on in the dark additionnally. So a security alarm
guards your house inside and the cameras guard your house outside. But there is some problem. You have to activate or deactivate smart alarm
function on each camera. If you have a lot of cameras it will be difficult to do every time.</p>
<p>Would be better when you activate the house security alarm and camera’s alarm will activate automatically. When you deactivate the house
security alarm  camera’s alarm will deactivate automatically as well.</p>
<p>My device connects to house security alarm. If you activate your house security alarm my device acivate alarm function on each camera.<>
When you deactivate your security system my device deactivate alarm function on the cameras. My device based on the ESP8266. It have connect
to home network to control smart alarm on the cameras through WiFi.</p>
